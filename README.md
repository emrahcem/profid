ProFID (Protocol for Frequent Items Discovery)
======
This is a java source code for the implementation of a gossip based protocol to find frequent items in a network. As the gossip-based algorithm is not centralized, it does not have a single point of failure issue. For more details about ProFID please refer to my paper titled [ProFID: Practical frequent items discovery in peer-to-peer networks](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2480149) and [my poster.](http://www.utdallas.edu/~emrah.cem/papers/ACM32012.pptx)

###How to Run
==============
You will simply run the profid.jar file. You can either double-click the profid.jar file or run the following command in the console

``java -jar /path/to/file/profid.jar``

to run the program.

###User Interface
=================
Interafce consist of two sets of parameters shown as two seperate tabs: 1) Network Parameters 2) ProFID Parameters. For the detailed explanations see the *Help -> How-to* menu.
