 You can run a simulation from a config file rather than choosing inputs using GUI.
 This may be more convenient to automate the simulation process. 
 An example config file (configFile.txt) is provided to help the user. 
 To run the simulation usingthe inputs in configFile.txt, 
 Choose File -> Simulate From File and choose the configFile.txt. 
 As the given config file creates the network graph from a file located in ./graph_neighborList.txt
 it should be in the directory where .jar file exists. If you put the graph_neighborList.txt 
 to any other directory, you can provide the path to this file in configFile.txt.
